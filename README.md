# Random-Quote-Generator

## Description

How to build an HTML random quote generator app from scratch using JavaScript? In this project I created a program that generates random quotes on the click of a button. To solve this problem, I created a dictionary. Authors used as the keys and the quotes as the values. We grab a random key and generate the quote associated with that key. You can see deployed app [here](https://mladen1506.github.io/random-quote-generator/)
